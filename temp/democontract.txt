TXSE Connectivity Services Agreement
This Connectivity Services Agreement (“Agreement”) is a binding agreement among you (“User”) and Texas Stock Exchange LLC (the “Exchange” or “TXSE”), with its principal office at 4550 Travis Street, Suite 650, Dallas, Texas 75205, and shall be effective as of the date executed on the signature page hereof (the “Effective Date”).
1. Services. This Agreement authorizes User to receive the Services. As used in this Agreement, “Services” shall mean (i) those services described on User’s connectivity order form (the “Order Form”) and (ii) any other connectivity services provided by the Exchange to User to the extent such services are not addressed by another agreement between the Exchange and User. User acknowledges and agrees that nothing in this Agreement constitutes an understanding by the Exchange to continue any aspect of the Services in their current form. The Exchange may from time to time make additions, deletions or modifications to the Services. In such event, the Exchange shall use commercially reasonable efforts to notify User prior to any such change becoming effective. User’s continued use of the Services following the modification will constitute User’s acceptance of the modification.
2. Connectivity and Redistribution. User is solely responsible for providing and maintaining all necessary electronic communications required to link to the Services, including wiring, computer hardware, software, communication line access and networking devices (as applicable). This Agreement authorizes User to access the Exchange physically in order to provide Authorized Third Parties (as defined herein) with access to the Exchange and/or certain data feeds associated therewith and/or certain other authorized non-Exchange services. In order to receive and/or redistribute Exchange data, User shall also enter into a market data agreement with the Exchange (the “Data Agreement”). Nothing herein shall limit User’s requirements and obligations arising under the Data Agreement, if applicable. User shall take reasonable security precautions to prevent unauthorized individuals or entities from gaining access to the Exchange. User shall comply with all reasonable security specifications or requirements of the Exchange in order to prevent the Exchange and Exchange data from being improperly used or accessed, or from being improperly taken. User shall not provide any third party with access to the Exchange or Exchange data unless such third party is an Authorized Third Party, pursuant to the Exchange’s prior written consent. For purposes of this Agreement, an “Authorized Third Party” is a party that the Exchange has approved to connect to the Exchange via connectivity supplied by User and/or to receive Exchange data or other Exchange authorized services transmitted through User.
2.1. Approval and Termination Notice Requirements. In order for a party to be approved as an Authorized Third Party, User must submit a request to the Exchange that includes the name and contact information of the party to whom connectivity will be provided. The Exchange will typically approve or reject a request within two (2) business days, but is under no obligation to respond within that time frame. Where a request is rejected by the Exchange, User may not provide the applicable party with connectivity to the Exchange. In the event User desires to terminate the provision of Services to an Authorized Third Party, User must submit written notice to the Exchange that identifies

the name of the Authorized Third Party and the effective date of such termination. All notifications submitted to the Exchange pursuant to this Agreement shall be given in accordance with the applicable Connectivity Manual, as may be amended from time to time (the “Connectivity Manual”). If any Authorized Third Party fails to comply with any of the conditions, terms or provisions of this Agreement, as applicable to such Authorized Third Party, a Data Agreement or any other agreement between an Authorized Third Party and the Exchange or an affiliate of the Exchange, and the Authorized Third Party has failed to cure such non-compliance within the cure period, if any, set forth in the applicable agreement, or if an Authorized Third Party has made any representation in any such agreement which was or has become untrue, then User shall, within five (5) business days after receipt of notice from the Exchange of such failure or untruth, cease providing access to the Exchange and/or Exchange data to such Authorized Third Party and shall, within seven (7) business days following the receipt of such notice, confirm such cessation by notice to the Exchange.
2.2. List of Authorized Third Parties. User shall maintain, keep current and provide to the Exchange promptly upon request a list of Authorized Third Parties to whom User provides access to the Exchange and/or certain data feeds associated therewith. Unless otherwise provided by the Exchange, User shall use reasonable efforts to respond to such a request within fifteen (15) days of receipt of the request.
2.3. Network Requirements. User must comply with all applicable TXSE Network Requirements, contained in the Connectivity Manual. The Exchange will provide notice of any material amendments to the TXSE Network Requirements and User shall comply with the amended TXSE Network Requirements within thirty (30) days of receipt of such notice.
3. Fees.
3.1. Services Fees. User agrees to make timely payment of all Services fees, as well as any applicable late fees, in accordance with the payment terms set forth in the Order Form or, if none are specified, within thirty (30) days of the invoice date. In the event of User’s failure to make payment within such time period, the Exchange reserves the right to terminate the subject Service or Services upon notice to User. User will be solely responsible for any and all telecommunications costs and all other expenses incurred in linking to, and maintaining its link to, the Services. User shall pay the Exchange a late charge in the amount of 1% per month on all past due amounts that are not the subject of a legitimate and bona fide dispute.
3.2. Adjustments to Services Fees. The Exchange may adjust the fees for the Services upon reasonable notice to User; provided, however, that the Exchange may pass through to User, without notice, any third party charges, fees, taxes or terms and conditions incurred by the Exchange in connection with the provision of Services. If User is receiving a physical connection from the Exchange, User may acquire a physical connection for transition purposes at no additional cost, provided that User transitions its connection within three (3) weeks from the date at which the replacement connection is live (i.e., the Exchange switchport is configured and connected to a User circuit or cross-

connect). If, after three (3) weeks, the legacy connection is not terminated, User will be charged for an additional connection.
4. Term. The initial, one (1) month term of this Agreement shall commence upon the Effective Date and shall automatically renew for additional one (1) month terms at the beginning of each subsequent calendar month thereafter, unless terminated by User or the Exchange as provided below.
5. Termination.
5.1. By User. User may terminate this Agreement, or cancel any physical connection provided hereunder, upon thirty (30) days’ prior written notice to the Exchange.
5.2. By the Exchange. The Exchange may terminate this Agreement, any or all of the Services provided hereunder or any authorization to allow connectivity to an Authorized Third Party at any time or from time to time upon thirty (30) days’ prior written notice to User. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Exchange may suspend or terminate the Services immediately upon notice to User if it determines, in the Exchange’s sole reasonable discretion, that: (i) User has breached any material term of this Agreement; (ii) User is engaged in activities that the Exchange determines are or may be detrimental to the Exchange, its investors or its Members (as defined in the Exchange Rules), as applicable including without limitation detrimental to the performance and operation of the Services; (iii) User has become insolvent; has made an assignment for the benefit of creditors; is not paying debts as they become due, or admits, in writing, its inability to pay debts when due; has filed, or has filed against it, any petition under any applicable bankruptcy laws or an application for a receiver, trustee or custodian of User is made by anyone; or User becomes the subject of any proceedings of bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, dissolution, receivership, liquidation or arrangement, adjustment or composition, or otherwise poses a credit risk to the Exchange, its investors or its Members; (iv) User is retransmitting or republishing any Exchange data feeds, including market data, or providing any connectivity to the Exchange without the prior approval of the Exchange; (v) User has violated any Exchange Rules; or (vi) if User is a Member, User ceases to be a Member in good standing with the Exchange or User is otherwise no longer authorized to use the Services; or (vii) any representations or warranties made by User in connection with this Agreement are or become false or misleading.
5.3. Consequences of Termination. Upon the termination of this Agreement for any reason, all rights granted to User hereunder will cease and User shall immediately pay to the Exchange any and all amounts owed to the Exchange under this Agreement, including without limitation all Services fees owed in respect of the entirety of the then current calendar month (e.g., if the Agreement is terminated on February 15th, Users shall nevertheless be required to pay the Exchange the monthly Services fees for the entirety of the month of February). The following Sections will survive the termination or expiration of this Agreement for any reason: Sections 3, 5.3 and 6 through 14. In no event will termination of this Agreement relieve User of any obligations incurred prior to the effective date of termination or through its use of or connection to the Services.
